    <h2>THIS IS JEOPARDY!</h2>
    <h3>But with a more personalized twist.</h3>
    <p>Do you love playing Jeopardy or trivia games, but want to test your skills only in a particular category? Then this is the game for you.</p>
    <p>The most frustrating part of trivia is having bad luck with the types of questions. The average player is likely not going to know trivia in every area of knowledge. This game, therefore, is designed to make everyone have a fair chance at a trivia game by narrowing the scope of the questions to make users feel included, engaged, and most importantly, have fun!</p>
    
    <br>
    <h4>How to play</h4>
    <p>In this version of the game, you can filter the questions so that you can play the game with questions that are most interesting to you. These questions are pulled from a dataset of <i>real</i> Jeopardy questions that aired in 2023.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>First, select a category group from the dropdown.</li>
        <li>Click "Start Game," and your first question will appear, replacing "undefined."</li> <li>You will have to answer 10 questions, and your goal is to get as many points as possible. There is no time limit.</li>
        <li>After your game, you can choose to finish, or restart and pick your category again. For any reason, if you want to restart mid-game, refresh the page and pick your category again.</li>
    </ol>
